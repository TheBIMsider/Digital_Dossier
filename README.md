Digital Dossier is an AI-enhanced personal website that elegantly showcases my resume and CV, while serving as a dynamic, easy-to-update platform for professional growth and learning.

This was an exercise in AI coding that served two purposes:

- Have a place to keep a digital copy of my resume and CV that can be easily updated and shared.
- Explore coding with AI assistance, in this case using tools like [v0 by Vercel](https://v0.dev/) and [Cursor - The AI Code Editor](https://www.cursor.com/).
